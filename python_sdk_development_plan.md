## Development Context

- **Feature**: Python client SDK for MCP (Meta-Cognitive Protocol). This SDK will provide a Pythonic interface for developers to interact with the MCP, enabling them to build applications on the Ouroboros system.
- **Technical Stack**:
    - Python 3.8+
    - `asyncio` for asynchronous operations
    - A suitable WebSocket library like `websockets` or `aiohttp` (assuming MCP uses WebSockets)
    - `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio` for testing
- **Constraints**:
    - Python 3.8+ compatibility
    - Adherence to PEP 8 (style) and PEP 484 (typing)
    - Asynchronous design using `async/await`
    - Dependency on an existing `mcp-protocol`
- **Success Criteria**:
    - A distributable Python package for the SDK.
    - The client can successfully connect to, send messages to, and receive messages from an MCP server.
    - Implemented automatic reconnection logic.
    - A clear hierarchy of custom exceptions for error handling.
    - Comprehensive type hints for all public APIs.
    - High test coverage.
    - Thorough documentation.
