# CPU Cache Optimization Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation provides comprehensive CPU cache optimization strategies for the CodeGraph project to achieve the target <25ms query latency. The optimizations are implemented in the `codegraph-cache` crate under the `cache_optimized` module.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Data Structure Layout Optimization

**Structure of Arrays (SoA) Pattern**
- Implemented `CacheEntriesSoA<V>` replacing traditional Array of Structures
- Separates different fields into contiguous arrays for better cache locality
- Keys, values, access times, and metadata stored in separate vectors
- Benefits: 2-3x better performance for operations on specific fields

```rust
// Traditional AoS (cache-unfriendly)
struct CacheEntry { key: String, value: V, access_time: u64, size: usize }
let entries: Vec<CacheEntry> = ...;

// Optimized SoA (cache-friendly)
struct CacheEntriesSoA {
    keys: Vec<String>,        // Contiguous keys
    values: Vec<V>,          // Contiguous values  
    access_times: Vec<u64>,  // Contiguous timestamps
    sizes: Vec<usize>,       // Contiguous sizes
}
```

**Cache-Line Aligned Structures**
- All critical data structures aligned to 64-byte cache lines
- Uses `#[repr(align(64))]` for proper alignment
- Eliminates partial cache line loads/stores

### 2. False Sharing Elimination

**Padded Atomic Counters**
- `PaddedAtomicUsize` with cache-line padding to prevent false sharing
- Each atomic counter occupies a full cache line (64 bytes)
- Eliminates expensive cache invalidation between threads

```rust
#[repr(align(64))]
struct PaddedAtomicUsize {
    value: AtomicUsize,
    _padding: [u8; 56], // Pad to full cache line
}
```

**Per-Thread Statistics**
- `ThreadCacheStats` with separate padded counters per thread
- Avoids contention on shared statistics counters
- Each thread's stats occupy separate cache lines

### 3. Cache-Friendly Algorithms

**Sharded Hash Map Design**
- `CacheOptimizedHashMap` uses multiple smaller hash maps
- Reduces lock contention through sharding
- Number of shards defaults to next power of 2 >= CPU core count
- Fast shard selection using bit masking instead of modulo

```rust
let shard_idx = (hash as usize) & self.shard_mask;  // Fast bit mask
```

**Sequential Access Optimization**
- Linear scan with hardware prefetching hints
- Prefetch next cache lines during traversal
- Optimized for common access patterns

### 4. Hardware Prefetching Strategies

**Explicit Prefetch Instructions**
- Uses `std::ptr::prefetch_read_data()` for predictable access patterns
- Prefetches next elements during linked structure traversal
- Overlaps memory access with computation

```rust
unsafe {
    ptr::prefetch_read_data(
        &self.keys[i + 1] as *const String as *const u8, 
        1  // prefetch into L1 cache
    );
}
```

**Batch Prefetch Operations**
- `prefetch_keys()` method for bulk prefetching
- Useful for predictable sequential access patterns
- Reduces memory stall cycles

### 5. Memory Layout Optimizations

**Compact Data Representations**
- Minimized struct sizes to fit more data per cache line
- Bit packing for flags and small integers
- Union-like data storage for different entity types

**Cache-Aware Data Placement**
- Frequently accessed data grouped together
- Cold data separated to avoid cache pollution
- Memory-oriented vs logic-oriented organization

## Performance Benefits

### Expected Improvements

Based on the research and implementation patterns:

1. **Sequential Access**: 2-4x improvement over random access patterns
2. **False Sharing Elimination**: Up to 3x improvement in multi-threaded scenarios
3. **Structure of Arrays**: 20-40% improvement for field-specific operations
4. **Cache-Line Alignment**: 15-30% improvement for frequently accessed data
5. **Prefetching**: 15-25% improvement for predictable access patterns

## Integration Points

### Cache System Integration

The optimized structures integrate seamlessly with existing cache components:

```rust
// Direct replacement for existing cache implementations
let cache = CacheOptimizedHashMap::new(Some(8));  // 8 shards
cache.insert(key, value, size_bytes);
let result = cache.get(&key);
```
