# CodeGraph

A sophisticated code analysis and embedding system built in Rust. CodeGraph provides graph-based code representation, vector search capabilities, and a comprehensive API for code understanding and analysis.

## Overview

CodeGraph transforms source code into intelligent, searchable knowledge graphs that enable advanced code understanding, analysis, and retrieval. Built with performance and scalability in mind, it supports multiple programming languages and provides both REST API access and embedding capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Multi-language Support** - Parse and analyze Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and more
- **Graph-based Analysis** - Rich code relationships and dependency tracking
- **Vector Embeddings** - Semantic code search using FAISS vector similarity
- **High Performance** - RocksDB storage with optimized graph operations
- **REST API** - Comprehensive HTTP API for integration
- **Thread-safe Operations** - Concurrent processing with Rust's safety guarantees

## Architecture

CodeGraph uses a modular workspace structure with specialized crates:

```
crates/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ codegraph-core/     # Core types, traits, and shared functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ codegraph-graph/    # Graph data structures and RocksDB storage  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ codegraph-parser/   # Tree-sitter based code parsing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ codegraph-vector/   # Vector embeddings and FAISS search
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ codegraph-api/      # REST API server using Axum
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ with Cargo
- System dependencies: clang, cmake (for native dependencies)

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd codegraph

# Build all crates
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Development with watching
make dev
```

### Running the API Server

```bash
# Start the REST API server
cargo run --bin codegraph-api

# The server will be available at http://localhost:8080
```

### Basic Usage

```rust
use codegraph_core::*;
use codegraph_parser::Parser;
use codegraph_graph::GraphStorage;

// Parse a source file
let parser = Parser::new();
let nodes = parser.parse_file("src/main.rs")?;

// Store in graph
let mut graph = GraphStorage::new("./graph_db")?;
graph.add_nodes(nodes)?;

// Query relationships
let deps = graph.find_dependencies(node_id)?;
```
