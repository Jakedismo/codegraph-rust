Validate that the build completes successfully with `cargo build --release`\n6. Run `cargo check` to verify no remaining issues\n7. Once build is successful, stage all changes with `git add .`\n8. Commit with descriptive message about build fixes applied\n9. Provide summary of what was fixed\n\nFocus on getting a clean, working Rust build without cutting corners or using mocks.",
