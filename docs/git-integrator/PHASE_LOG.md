## Phase 0: Initial Requirements Analysis

- Feature: Git repository integration with libgit2
- Technical Stack: Rust, git2, notify, tokio, thiserror, tracing
- Constraints: Large-repo efficiency; async-safe; cross-platform hooks
- Success Criteria: Hooks, branch tracking, change detection, merge strategies, history insights, unit tests

Status: Completed

## Phase 1: Context7 Library Research

- git2 API coverage used: Revwalk, Diff/Stats, MergeOptions (FileFavor), merge_analysis
- notify usage: recommended_watcher, debounce, ignore `.git/`

Status: Completed (see README.md for notes)

## Phase 2: Current Best Practices

- Conflicts: prefer small/short-lived branches; rebase/merge often
- Watchers: debounce and offload work; ignore internal dirs
- Large repos: limit revwalk; use `Diff::stats()`

Status: Completed (snapshot via web search)

## Phase 3: Dev Guild Coordination

- Notified dev_guild of development start via A2A inbox

Status: Completed

## Phase 4: Architecture Alignment

- Pattern: Dedicated `codegraph-git` crate; stable API for repo ops
- Interfaces: `GitRepository`, `RepoWatcher`, `HistoryInsights`
- Constraints: No API server changes in this iteration

Status: Aligned

## Phase 5: TDD Setup

- Added basic tests for hooks, commit + status, history
- Coverage: Core flows in this crate; broader workspace tests unchanged

Status: Created

## Phase 6: Core Implementation

- Implemented hooks, branch tracking, change detection, merge strategies, history analysis, watcher
- `cargo check` passes

Status: Completed

## Phase 7: Code Quality Optimization

- Initial pass; performance-friendly defaults used
- Future: async wrappers with `spawn_blocking`, deeper per-file churn

Status: Initial

## Phase 8â€“9: Integration/Security

- Pending API wiring and security validation

## Phase 10: Code Review Preparation

### Code Review Package

- Feature: Git Integrator
- Files Modified: crates/codegraph-git/*, Cargo.toml, docs/git-integrator/*
- Lines Changed: minimal, focused per crate addition

Testing

- Unit Test Coverage: basic in new crate
- Integration: not wired to API yet

Documentation

- README.md updated for git integrator; phase log present

## Phase 14: Knowledge Sharing

- Documented patterns and practices in README.md

## Phase 15: Reflection & Improvement

What Worked

- Clean isolation in new crate
- Efficient history analysis using stats

Challenges

- libgit2 merge API ergonomics
- Global workspace tests failing in unrelated crates (left untouched)

Recommendations

- Add async wrappers; extend conflict resolution utilities
- API endpoints for insights and hooks management

## Phase 16: Evolution Protocols

- Submitted evolution request via MAO tool with goals: richer merge strategies and async wrappers
