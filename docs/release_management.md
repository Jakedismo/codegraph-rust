# CodeGraph Release Management Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive release management system for CodeGraph, designed to ensure zero-downtime production deployments while maintaining the system's strict performance requirements (sub-50ms P99 latency, >10,000 QPS throughput).

## Architecture Alignment

Our release management system is specifically designed around CodeGraph's architecture targets:

- **Latency**: Sub-50ms P95 response times maintained during deployments
- **Throughput**: >10,000 QPS sustained during rolling updates
- **Memory Efficiency**: <500MB footprint for 100k LOC processing
- **Cache Performance**: >92% hit rates preserved across deployments
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with zero-downtime deployments

## Release Pipeline Components

### 1. Automated Release Pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Git tag pushes (`v*`)
- Manual workflow dispatch with environment selection

**Key Features:**
- Multi-platform binary builds (Linux x86_64/ARM64, macOS, Windows)
- Size-optimized container images using `release-size` profile
- Crates.io publishing for workspace components
- Automated changelog generation

**Deployment Strategies:**
- **Rolling Updates**: Default for staging, gradual pod replacement
- **Blue-Green**: Complete environment switch, instant rollback capability
- **Canary**: Traffic-weighted deployments with automatic promotion/rollback

### 2. Emergency Rollback System (`.github/workflows/rollback.yml`)

**Safety Features:**
- Explicit confirmation requirement (`CONFIRM` input)
- Pre-rollback state backup creation
- Target version validation against git history
- Database migration rollback (when applicable)

**Rollback Phases:**
1. **Validation**: Confirm target version exists and is valid
2. **Backup**: Create complete state snapshot (K8s resources, configs, secrets)
3. **Database Rollback**: Handle schema downgrades if needed
4. **Application Rollback**: Execute deployment strategy-specific rollback
5. **Verification**: Comprehensive post-rollback validation
6. **Notification**: Automated incident reporting and stakeholder alerts

### 3. Deployment Validation Framework (`scripts/deploy/validate.sh`)

**Comprehensive Health Checks:**
- Authentication-aware endpoint validation
- HTTP/2 optimization feature testing
- GraphQL query execution verification
- Prometheus metrics availability validation
- Performance benchmarking (response time thresholds)
- Concurrent request handling (configurable load testing)
- Security header compliance verification

**Configuration Options:**
```bash
# Basic usage
BASE_URL=https://api.codegraph.com scripts/deploy/validate.sh

# Advanced configuration
BASE_URL=https://staging.codegraph.com \
  TIMEOUT_SECS=120 \
  CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=50 \
  MAX_RESPONSE_TIME_MS=200 \
  VERBOSE=true \
  scripts/deploy/validate.sh
```

### 4. Production Monitoring (`monitoring/`)

**Prometheus Alerting Rules** (`prometheus-rules.yml`):
- **Application Health**: Service availability, endpoint response times
- **Performance Monitoring**: Latency percentiles, throughput tracking
- **Resource Utilization**: Memory, CPU, disk usage with architecture-aligned thresholds
- **Database Health**: RocksDB performance, FAISS index efficiency
- **Cache Performance**: Hit rates, eviction patterns
- **Security Compliance**: Authentication failures, rate limiting triggers

**Grafana Dashboard** (`grafana-dashboard.json`):
- Real-time performance metrics visualization
- Architecture target compliance tracking
- Deployment event correlation
- Resource utilization trends
- Cache performance analysis

## Release Process Workflows

### Standard Release Process

1. **Pre-Release Validation**
   ```bash
   # Run comprehensive checks
   make ci
   make load-test
   make deploy-validate
   ```

2. **Release Creation**
   - Create git tag: `git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"`
   - Push tag: `git push origin v1.2.3`
   - Pipeline automatically triggers

3. **Staging Deployment**
   - Automatic deployment to staging environment
   - Full validation suite execution
   - Performance regression testing

4. **Production Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Manual workflow dispatch with production target
   gh workflow run release.yml \
     -f version=v1.2.3 \
     -f environment=production \
     -f deployment_strategy=canary
   ```

5. **Post-Deployment Monitoring**
   - Grafana dashboard monitoring
   - Prometheus alert verification
   - Performance metrics validation

### Emergency Rollback Process

1. **Trigger Rollback**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run rollback.yml \
     -f target_version=v1.2.2 \
     -f environment=production \
     -f reason="Critical performance regression" \
     -f confirmation=CONFIRM
   ```

2. **Automatic Execution**
   - Version validation and backup creation
   - Database migration rollback (if needed)
   - Application deployment rollback
   - Health verification and stakeholder notification

### Deployment Strategies

#### Rolling Updates
- **Use Case**: Standard releases, low-risk changes
- **Characteristics**: Gradual pod replacement, maintains capacity
- **Rollback**: Kubernetes native rollback capabilities

#### Blue-Green Deployment
- **Use Case**: Major releases, database schema changes
- **Characteristics**: Complete environment duplication
- **Rollback**: Instant traffic switch to previous environment

#### Canary Deployment
- **Use Case**: High-risk changes, experimental features
- **Characteristics**: Traffic-weighted gradual rollout
- **Rollback**: Automatic based on performance metrics

## Performance Monitoring Integration

### Key Performance Indicators

**Latency Monitoring:**
```yaml
# P95 latency threshold
- alert: HighLatency
  expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, http_request_duration_seconds) > 0.05
  for: 2m
```

**Throughput Tracking:**
```yaml
# QPS threshold monitoring  
- alert: LowThroughput
  expr: rate(http_requests_total[5m]) < 10000
  for: 5m
```

**Cache Performance:**
```yaml
# Cache hit rate monitoring
- alert: LowCacheHitRate
  expr: cache_hit_ratio < 0.92
  for: 3m
```

### Deployment Event Correlation

Grafana dashboard includes deployment annotations that correlate releases with performance changes, enabling rapid identification of deployment-related issues.

## Security and Compliance

### Pre-Deployment Security Checks
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Dependency audit with `cargo audit`
- Security header validation in deployment tests

### Runtime Security Monitoring
- Authentication failure tracking
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- API key usage patterns

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Build Failures:**
```bash
# Clear build cache and retry
cargo clean
make build-release
```

**Deployment Validation Failures:**
```bash
# Debug with verbose output
VERBOSE=true BASE_URL=https://staging.codegraph.com scripts/deploy/validate.sh
```

**Performance Regression:**
```bash
# Compare against baseline
make perf-regression
```

**Rollback Issues:**
- Check target version exists in git history
- Verify Kubernetes access credentials
- Confirm backup creation succeeded

### Monitoring and Alerting

**Critical Alerts:**
- Service unavailability (>1 minute)
- P95 latency >50ms (>2 minutes)
- Cache hit rate <92% (>3 minutes)
- Memory usage >500MB (>5 minutes)

**Dashboard Access:**
- Production: `https://grafana.codegraph.com/d/codegraph-prod`
- Staging: `https://grafana.codegraph.com/d/codegraph-staging`

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Automated state backups before each deployment
- RocksDB snapshot preservation
- Configuration and secret backup
- 30-day retention policy

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Service Restoration**: Emergency rollback to last known good version
2. **Data Recovery**: RocksDB restoration from snapshots
3. **Configuration Recovery**: K8s resource restoration from backups
4. **Validation**: Complete deployment validation suite execution

## Continuous Improvement

### Performance Baseline Management
```bash
# Update performance baselines after successful releases
BASELINE_NAME=v1.2.3 make bench
make bench-report
```

### Release Metrics Tracking
- Deployment success rate
- Rollback frequency
- Time to recovery
- Performance impact measurement

### Feedback Integration
