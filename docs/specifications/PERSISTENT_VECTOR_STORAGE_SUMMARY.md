# Persistent Vector Storage System for CodeGraph

## Overview

A comprehensive persistent vector storage system has been implemented for CodeGraph embeddings, providing production-ready durability, consistency, and performance optimizations.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Memory-Mapped Vector Storage (`persistent.rs`)

**Features:**
- Memory-mapped file storage with efficient binary serialization
- Atomic file operations with temporary files and atomic replacement
- Comprehensive metadata tracking (timestamps, checksums, vector counts)
- Configurable storage headers with version compatibility

**Key Classes:**
- `PersistentVectorStore`: Main storage implementation
- `StorageHeader`: File format metadata and integrity information
- `VectorMetadata`: Per-vector metadata (timestamps, compression info, etc.)

### 2. Vector Compression Techniques (`persistent.rs`)

**Product Quantization (PQ):**
- Configurable number of subquantizers (m) and bits per subquantizer
- K-means clustering for centroid training
- Automatic compression ratio tracking
- Lossless encoding/decoding with error handling

**Scalar Quantization (SQ):**
- Uniform and non-uniform quantization options
- Per-dimension or global min/max scaling
- Efficient bit packing (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit)
- Configurable precision levels

**Features:**
- Automatic training on sample data
- Transparent compression/decompression
- Compression ratio monitoring and statistics

### 3. Incremental Index Updates (`incremental.rs`)

**Segmented Architecture:**
- Index segments with automatic sealing based on size and age
- Lock-free concurrent operations using DashMap
- Parallel processing for large batches using Rayon
- Efficient segment merging for optimization

**Update Operations:**
- Insert, Update, Delete, and Batch operations
- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for durability
- Configurable batch sizes and timeouts
- Background worker threads for async processing

**Performance Features:**
- Parallel processing with configurable thresholds
- Automatic segment management and merging
- Performance statistics and monitoring
- Configurable worker thread pools

### 4. Backup and Recovery Mechanisms (`persistent.rs`)

**Backup Features:**
- Timestamped backup creation with metadata
- Atomic backup operations
- Backup verification and integrity checks
- Configurable backup retention policies

**Recovery Features:**
- Point-in-time recovery from backups
- Automatic backup validation before restore
- Graceful fallback on corruption detection
- Incremental update log replay

### 5. Durability and Consistency Guarantees (`consistency.rs`)

**ACID Transaction Support:**
- Four isolation levels (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable)
- Two-phase commit protocol implementation
- Deadlock detection and prevention
- Fine-grained locking with multiple lock modes

**Consistency Features:**
- Transaction conflict detection
- Read/write set tracking for isolation
- Automatic transaction timeout handling
- Rollback operation generation for failed transactions

**Durability Features:**
- Write-Ahead Logging with configurable flush intervals
- Consistency checkpoints with metadata checksums
- Transaction log persistence and recovery
- Background cleanup of expired transactions

### 6. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/persistent_integration_tests.rs`)

**Test Coverage:**
- Storage lifecycle (create, store, retrieve)
- Compression techniques (PQ and SQ)
- Backup and recovery scenarios
- Incremental update operations
- Consistency manager transactions
- Lock acquisition and conflict resolution
- Performance under load testing
- Persistence across restarts

### 7. API Integration (`handlers.rs`)

**New REST Endpoints:**
- `GET /storage/stats` - Storage statistics and metrics
- `GET /storage/incremental/stats` - Incremental update statistics
- `GET /storage/transactions/stats` - Transaction system statistics
- `POST /storage/compression` - Enable vector compression
- `POST /storage/backup` - Create storage backup
- `POST /storage/restore` - Restore from backup
- `POST /storage/transaction` - Execute transactional operations
- `POST /storage/merge-segments` - Trigger segment optimization
- `POST /storage/flush` - Force flush pending operations

## Technical Specifications

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```rust
// Create persistent storage
let mut store = PersistentVectorStore::new("./vectors.db", "./backups", 768)?;

// Enable compression
store.enable_product_quantization(16, 8)?;

// Store embeddings
store.store_embeddings(&nodes).await?;

// Create backup
let backup_path = store.create_backup().await?;
```

### Transaction Example
```rust
// Begin transaction
let txn_id = consistency_manager.begin_transaction(IsolationLevel::Serializable)?;

// Add operations
consistency_manager.add_operation(txn_id, VectorOperation::Insert {
    node_id: 123,
    vector: vec![0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
})?;

// Commit transaction
consistency_manager.prepare_transaction(txn_id)?;
consistency_manager.commit_transaction(txn_id)?;
```

### Incremental Updates
```rust
// Create incremental manager
let manager = IncrementalUpdateManager::new(config)?;

// Submit batch updates
manager.submit_batch(vec![
    IncrementalOperation::Insert { node_id: 1, vector: vec![0.1, 0.2] },
    IncrementalOperation::Update { node_id: 2, new_vector: vec![0.3, 0.4] },
])?;
```
