# CodeGraph MCP - Initial Instructions for AI Agents

## Introduction

CodeGraph is an **autonomous code intelligence system** powered by multi-step reasoning and graph analysis. Unlike traditional code search tools, CodeGraph's **agentic tools** autonomously decide which graph analysis functions to call based on your natural language queries.

**Critical principle:** Use CodeGraph's agentic tools for **all codebase exploration**. These tools provide condensed, semantically-relevant, graph-analyzed context without burning your context window.

---

## Core Philosophy: Autonomous Graph Intelligence

### ❌ The Old Way (Manual Graph Exploration)
```
Agent manually calls:
1. search_code("authentication")
2. get_dependencies(node_id_1)
3. get_dependencies(node_id_2)
4. get_dependencies(node_id_3)
5. trace_call_chain(node_id_1)
... 15 more manual tool calls

Result: Burned 500 lines of context, still incomplete picture
```

### ✅ The CodeGraph Way (Autonomous Agentic)
```
Agent: agentic_dependency_analysis("how does authentication integrate with the database?")

CodeGraph autonomously:
- Searches for authentication code
- Identifies relevant nodes
- Traces transitive dependencies
- Analyzes coupling metrics
- Maps call chains
- Synthesizes findings

Result: Comprehensive answer in 150 lines, complete architectural understanding
```

**The difference:** CodeGraph's LLM agent autonomously orchestrates graph exploration. You just ask the question.

## How Agentic Tools Work

### Architecture Overview

```
Your Query
    ↓
Agentic Tool (with multi-step reasoning)
    ↓
Autonomous LLM Decision-Making:
  - Which graph functions to call?
  - What order to call them?
  - How deep to traverse?
  - What patterns to look for?
    ↓
SurrealDB Graph Functions:
  - fn::get_transitive_dependencies()
  - fn::get_reverse_dependencies()
  - fn::trace_call_chain()
  - fn::calculate_coupling_metrics()
  - fn::get_hub_nodes()
  - fn::detect_circular_dependencies()
    ↓
Synthesized, Context-Efficient Answer
```

### 4-Tier Context System

CodeGraph automatically selects the appropriate tier based on your LLM's context window:

| Tier | Context Window | Output Tokens | Best For |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| **Tier 1: Nano** | <32k | 2,048 | Quick lookups, simple queries |
| **Tier 2: Standard** | 32k-128k | 8,192 | Most queries, balanced depth |
| **Tier 3: Extended** | 128k-200k | 32,768 | Complex analysis, deep exploration |
| **Tier 4: Mega** | 200k+ | 131,072 | Comprehensive architectural analysis |

**You don't configure this** - CodeGraph detects your context window and auto-selects the tier.

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:

1. **Ask natural language questions** - The agentic tools understand intent
   - ✅ "how does authentication integrate with the database?"
   - ✅ "what will break if I refactor the UserService?"

2. **Trust autonomous exploration** - Let CodeGraph decide which graph functions to call
   - ✅ One tool call with comprehensive question
   - ❌ Not manually calling multiple graph functions

3. **Use specialized tools** - Each tool is optimized for specific analysis types
   - ✅ `agentic_dependency_analysis` for impact analysis
   - ❌ Not using `agentic_code_search` for everything

4. **Start broad, then narrow** - Begin with overview, drill down as needed
   - ✅ `agentic_architecture_analysis` → `agentic_code_search` for specifics
   - ❌ Not immediately searching for specific functions

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Don't manually read files first** - Use CodeGraph tools to find relevant code
   - ❌ Reading src/auth/*.rs before understanding the system
   - ✅ `agentic_code_search("authentication system")` first

2. **Don't bypass agentic tools** - They provide autonomy and graph intelligence
   - ❌ Trying to call SurrealDB functions directly
   - ✅ Using agentic tools which autonomously orchestrate graph functions

3. **Don't ask overly narrow questions initially** - Start with context
   - ❌ "find the validateToken function"
   - ✅ "how does token validation work in the authentication system?"

4. **Don't ignore the autonomous results** - CodeGraph explored the graph intelligently
   - ❌ Immediately searching for more after getting results
   - ✅ Reading and understanding what CodeGraph autonomously discovered

## Context Efficiency Comparison

### Manual Exploration (Old Way)
```
Task: "Understand authentication system"

Manual approach:
- Read auth/login.rs (300 lines)
- Read auth/session.rs (250 lines)
- Read middleware/auth_middleware.rs (400 lines)
- Read models/user.rs (500 lines)
- Read config/auth_config.rs (150 lines)
- Read database/user_repository.rs (350 lines)

Total: 1,950 lines read
Relevant: ~200 lines (10%)
Context burned: 90% waste
Time: 30+ minutes of reading
```

### Agentic Exploration (CodeGraph Way)
```
Task: "Understand authentication system"

Agentic approach:
→ agentic_architecture_analysis("analyze authentication system architecture")

Returns:
- Layered architecture breakdown
- Key components and their relationships
- Auth flow with code excerpts
- Design patterns identified
- Security considerations

Total: ~250 lines of RELEVANT content
Relevant: ~250 lines (100%)
Context efficiency: 87% reduction
Time: 5-10 seconds for complete understanding
```

**Result:** 7.8x more efficient with better understanding.

## Understanding the Autonomous Nature

### What "Agentic" Means

When you call an agentic tool, here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. **Your query is analyzed** by an LLM agent
2. **The agent reasons** about which graph functions to call
3. **Multi-step exploration** happens autonomously:
   - Search for relevant nodes
   - Follow dependency chains
   - Calculate metrics
   - Detect patterns
   - Trace call paths
4. **Results are synthesized** into a coherent answer

**You don't:**
- Specify which graph functions to call
- Decide traversal depth
- Choose analysis order
- Manage intermediate results

**CodeGraph does all of this autonomously.**

### The Graph Functions (Under the Hood)

CodeGraph uses these SurrealDB functions autonomously:

- `fn::get_transitive_dependencies()` - Follow dependency chains forward
- `fn::get_reverse_dependencies()` - Follow dependency chains backward
- `fn::trace_call_chain()` - Trace execution paths
- `fn::calculate_coupling_metrics()` - Compute afferent/efferent coupling
- `fn::get_hub_nodes()` - Find highly connected nodes
- `fn::detect_circular_dependencies()` - Find dependency cycles

**You never call these directly** - the agentic tools orchestrate them autonomously.

## Quick Start Checklist

When starting work on a codebase with CodeGraph:

- [ ] Use `agentic_architecture_analysis` to understand overall structure
- [ ] Use `agentic_code_search` for your first exploration question
- [ ] Let autonomous exploration work - don't immediately search for more
- [ ] Use specialized tools for specific analysis types
- [ ] Read the comprehensive results before making decisions
- [ ] Only read source files after CodeGraph narrows down locations
- [ ] Trust the multi-step reasoning - it explored the graph intelligently

---

## Remember

**CodeGraph provides autonomous, graph-powered code intelligence.**

The goals:
1. **Autonomous exploration** - The LLM agent orchestrates graph analysis
2. **Context efficiency** - Get comprehensive understanding in minimal context
3. **Graph-powered insights** - Leverage SurrealDB graph functions automatically
4. **Multi-step reasoning** - Complex analysis happens in one tool call

**Key principle:** Just ask your question in natural language. CodeGraph autonomously:
- Decides which graph functions to call
- Explores the dependency graph
- Synthesizes findings
- Provides comprehensive, context-efficient answers

**Default workflow:** Ask question → Read autonomous analysis → Make informed decisions
